# What's this?

As a part of the competitive entrance process to their Software Engineering Summit, Capital One had potential summiteers create a mobile friendly web app that would allow users to search the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) for movies, presenting these movies in an aesthetically pleasing format.
I created such a web app, using ReactJS and TailwindCSS, which merited me admission into the C1 SES.

# See it in action!
